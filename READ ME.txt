1. Setting DataBase
    Use VillageBook_FINAL\src\main\webapp\WEB-INF\lib\villagebook.sql 
    And Create All table and sequence, then you can insert all data Record.
2. Setting File Upload Path
    In BookController.java, Set your project upload path of \img\book\.
    In my Case, I used VillageBook_FINAL in C:\Users\dek06\OneDrive\문서\workspace_java\. 
    Also, I put book image folder, /img/book/ in project VillageBook_FINAL. So you can change at your will.
    But, if you change Upload File path in Insert Book of library mood , you must change that in Update Book too.
3. If you insert Book Image in /img/book/, you want to check whether you right image file or not.
   Then, in Eclipse Package Explorer, Refresh /img/book/ folder!

Then Enjoy your Coding.
